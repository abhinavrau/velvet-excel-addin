- Creates a test case table that measures accuracy for the following metrics:
    - **Summary Match (True/False)**: Semantically match the actual summary returned with the expected summary. This uses the PaLM2 model to measure semantic similarity using [the following prompt](https://github.com/abhinavrau/velvet-excel-addin/blob/f532763488eb03c93b24e372ab650997e1acbee0/src/vertex_ai.js#L66).
    - **First Link Match (True/False)**: The actual first document link returned matches the expected document link.
