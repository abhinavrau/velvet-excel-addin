Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as\nrevenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance\nwith relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when\nwe expect to recognize such as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next\n24 months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded\nas well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less\nand cancellable contracts.\n\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are\nrefundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021\nwas $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022."

              "content": "We delivered Free Cash Flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We\nended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total\nof $59 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2022.\nTurning to our segment results, starting with Google Services, Revenues were $67.8 billion,\ndown 2%. Google Search and Other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were\ndown 2%. Search delivered moderate underlying growth in Q4, absent the impact of currency\nmovements on reported results. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion, were down 8%.\nNetwork advertising revenues of $8.5 billion, were down 9%.\nOther Revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors. First, significant subscriber\ngrowth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. Second, strong growth in Hardware\nrevenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these two areas was a\nyear-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind\nin APAC, as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees.\nTAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%.\nGoogle Services Operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%, and the operating margin was\n31%.\n\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%.\nRevenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both\ninfrastructure and platform services. Google Workspace’s strong results were driven by\nincreases in both seats and average revenue per seat. In Q4, we saw slower growth of\nconsumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop. Google Cloud\nhad an Operating Loss of $480 million.\nAs to our Other Bets, for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion and the operating loss\nwas $6.1 billion.\nTurning to our outlook for the business. In 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected\nby a number of challenges. First, we faced very tough comps given the outsized recovery in\n2021 from the impact of the pandemic. Second, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout\nthe year. And third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic\nclimate that also impacted many of our customers and which remains ongoing.\nWithin Google Services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term\nrevenue growth.\nFirst, within Advertising, we are focused on using advances in AI to drive new and better\nexperiences for users in Search, as well as to deliver better measurement, higher ROI and tools\nfor more compelling creative content to advertisers.\n\n9"
